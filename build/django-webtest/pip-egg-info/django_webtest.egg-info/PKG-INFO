        django-webtest
        ==============
        
        django-webtest is an app for instant integration of Ian Bicking's
        WebTest (http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/) with django's
        testing framework.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            from django_webtest import WebTest
        
            class MyTestCase(WebTest):
        
                # optional: we want some initial data to be able to login
                fixtures = ['users', 'blog_posts']
        
                # optional: default extra_environ for this TestCase
                extra_environ = {'HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE': 'ru'}
        
                def testBlog(self):
                    # pretend to be logged in as user `kmike` and go to the index page
                    index = self.app.get('/', user='kmike')
        
                    # All the webtest API is available. For example, we click
                    # on a <a href='/tech-blog/'>Blog</a> link, check that it
                    # works (result page doesn't raise exceptions and returns 200 http
                    # code) and test if result page have 'My Article' text in
                    # it's body.
                    assert 'My Article' in index.click('Blog')
        
        django-webtest provides django.test.TestCase subclass (``WebTest``) that creates
        ``webtest.TestApp`` around django wsgi interface and make it available in
        tests as ``self.app``.
        
        It also features optional ``user`` argument for ``self.app.get`` and
        ``self.app.post`` methods to help making authorized requests. This argument
        should be django.contrib.auth.models.User instance or a string with user's
        ``username`` for user who is supposed to be logged in.
        
        For 500 errors original traceback is shown instead of usual html result
        from handler500.
        
        You also get the ``response.templates`` and ``response.context`` goodness that
        is usually only available if you use django's native test client. These
        attributes contain a list of templates that were used to render the response
        and the context used to render these templates. All django's native asserts (
        ``assertFormError``,  ``assertTemplateUsed``, ``assertTemplateNotUsed``,
        ``assertContains``, ``assertNotContains``, ``assertRedirects``) are
        also supported for WebTest responses.
        
        The session dictionary is available via ``self.app.session``, and has the
        content as django's native test client.
        
        Unlike django's native test client CSRF checks are not suppressed
        by default so missing CSRF tokens will cause test fails (and that's good).
        
        If forms are submitted via WebTest forms API then all form fields (including
        CSRF token) are submitted automagically::
        
            class AuthTest(WebTest):
                fixtures = ['users.json']
        
                def test_login(self)
                    form = self.app.get(reverse('auth_login')).form
                    form['username'] = 'foo'
                    form['password'] = 'bar'
                    response = form.submit().follow()
                    self.assertEqual(response.context['user'].username, 'foo')
        
        However if forms are submitted via raw POST requests using ``app.post`` then
        csrf tokens become hard to construct. CSRF checks can be disabled by setting
        ``csrf_checks`` attribute to False in this case::
        
            class MyTestCase(WebTest):
                csrf_checks = False
                def test_post(self)
                    self.app.post('/')
        
        All of these features can be easily set up manually (thanks to WebTest
        architecture) and they are even not neccessary for using WebTest with django but
        it is nice to have some sort of integration instantly.
        
        See http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/ for API help. It can follow links, submit
        forms, parse html, xml and json responses with different parsing libraries,
        upload files and more.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install webtest
            $ pip install django-webtest
        
        Why?
        ====
        
        While django.test.client.Client is fine for it's purposes, it is not
        well-suited for functional or integration testing. From django's test client
        docstring:
        
            This is not intended as a replacement for Twill/Selenium or
            the like - it is here to allow testing against the
            contexts and templates produced by a view, rather than the
            HTML rendered to the end-user.
        
        WebTest plays on the same field as twill. WebTest has nice API, is fast, small,
        talk to django application via WSGI instead of HTTP and is an easy way to
        write functional/integration/acceptance tests.
        
        Twill is also a great tool and it also can be easily integrated with django
        (see django-test-utils package) and I also enjoy it much. But I prefer WebTest
        over twill because twill is old (last release is in 2007), communicate via HTTP
        instead of WSGI (though there is workaround for that), lacks support for
        unicode and have a much larger codebase to hack on. django-webtest also
        is able to provide access to the names of rendered templates and
        template context just like native django TestClient. Twill however understands
        HTML better and is more mature so consider it if WebTest doesn't fit for
        some reason.
        
        CHANGES
        =======
        
        1.4.4 (2012-02-08)
        ------------------
        
        - 'user' parameter for ``self.app.put`` and ``self.app.delete`` methods.
        
        1.4.3 (2011-09-27)
        ------------------
        
        - The django session dictionary is available via ``self.app.session``.
        
        1.4.2 (2011-08-26)
        ------------------
        
        - ``REMOTE_ADDR`` is now ``'127.0.0.1'`` by default. This is how
          standard django's test client behave.
        
          Please note that this can slow tests down and cause other side effects
          if django-debug-toolbar 0.9.x is installed+configured and
          ``INTERNAL_IPS`` contain ``'127.0.0.1'`` because debug toolbar will
          become turned on during tests. The workaround is to remove
          django-debug-toolbar middleware during tests in your test settings::
        
              DEBUG_MIDDLEWARE = 'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware'
              if DEBUG_MIDDLEWARE in MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:
                  MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.remove(DEBUG_MIDDLEWARE)
        
        
        1.4.1 (2011-06-29)
        ------------------
        
        - ``self.renew_app()`` method for resetting the 'browser' inside tests.
        
        1.4 (2011-06-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Better auth implementation;
        - support for assertRedirects, assertContains and assertNotContains.
        
        1.3 (2010-12-31)
        ----------------
        
        - Django 1.3 compatibility: test responses are now having 'templates' attribute;
        - Django 1.3 compatibility: the way exceptions are handled is changed;
        - auto_follow parameter for app.get method (redirect chains will be
          auto-followed with auto_follow=True).
        
        1.2.1 (2010-08-24)
        ------------------
        
        - REMOTE_USER authorization can be disabled.
        
        1.2 (2010-08-21)
        ----------------
        
        - ``response.template`` and ``response.context`` goodness (thanks Gregor Müllegger);
        - tests (thanks Gregor Müllegger);
        - csrf checks are now optional (thanks Gregor Müllegger).
        
        1.1.1 (2010-07-16)
        ------------------
        
        - User instance can be passed to `get` and `post` methods instead
          of user's username.
        
        1.1 (2010-06-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Original traceback instead of html 500 error page;
        - per-TestCase extra_environ (thanks Gael Pasgrimaud);
        - fixed a bug with app.post parameters (thanks anonymous).
        
        
        1.0 (2010-04-20)
        ----------------
        Initial release (thanks Ian Bicking for WebTest).
