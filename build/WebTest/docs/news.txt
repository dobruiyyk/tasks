* print_stderr fail with unicode string on python2

1.3.1
-----

* Fix #21

* Full python3 compat

1.3
---

* Moved TestApp to app.py

* Added selenium testing framework. See :mod:`~webtest.sel` module.


1.2.4
------

* Accept lists for ``app.post(url, params=[...])``

* Allow to use url that starts with the SCRIPT_NAME found in extra_environ

* Fix `#16 <https://bitbucket.org/ianb/webtest/issue/16>`_  Default
  content-type is now correctly set to `application/octet-stream`

* Fix `#14 and #18 <https://bitbucket.org/ianb/webtest/issue/18>`_ Allow to use
  `.delete(params={})`

* Fix `#12 <https://bitbucket.org/ianb/webtest/issue/12>`_ 


1.2.3
-----

* Fix `#10
  <http://bitbucket.org/ianb/webtest/issue/10/testapprequest-method-overwrites-specifics-with-testapp-scoped>`_,
  now `TestApp.extra_environ` doesn't take precedence over a WSGI
  environment passed in through the request.

* Removed stray print

1.2.2
-----

* Revert change to cookies that would add ``"`` around cookie values.

* Added property :meth:`webtest.Response.pyquery` which returns a
  `PyQuery <http://pyquery.org/>`_ object.

* Set base_url on ``resp.lxml``

* Include tests and docs in tarball.

* Fix sending in webob.Request (or webtest.TestRequest) objects.

* Fix handling forms with file uploads, when no file is selected.

* Added ``extra_environ`` argument to :meth:`webtest.TestResponse.click`.

* Fixed/added wildcard statuses, like ``status="4*"``

* Fix file upload fields in forms: allow upload field to be empty.

* Added support for single-quoted html attributes.

* `TestResponse` now has unicode support. It is turned on by default
  for all responses with charset information. **This is backward
  incompatible change** if you rely (e.g. in doctests) on parsed
  form fields or responses returned by `json` and `lxml` methods
  being encoded strings when charset header is in response. In order
  to switch to old behaviour pass `use_unicode=False` flag to
  `TestApp` constructor.


1.2.1
-----

* Added method :meth:`TestApp.request`, which can be used for
  sending requests with different methods (e.g., ``MKCOL``).  This
  method sends all its keyword arguments to
  :meth:`webtest.TestRequest.blank` and then executes the request.
  The parameters are somewhat different than other methods (like
  :meth:`webtest.TestApp.get`), as they match WebOb's attribute
  names exactly (the other methods were written before WebOb existed).

* Removed the copying of stdout to stderr during requests.

* Fix file upload fields in forms (`#340
  <http://trac.pythonpaste.org/pythonpaste/ticket/340>`_) -- you could
  upload files with :meth:`webtest.TestApp.post`, but if you use
  ``resp.form`` file upload fields would not work (from rcs-comp.com
  and Matthew Desmarais).

1.2
---

* Fix form inputs; text inputs always default to the empty string, and
  unselected radio inputs default to nothing at all.  From Daniele
  Paolella.

* Fix following links with fragments (these fragments should not be
  sent to the WSGI application).  From desmaj.

* Added ``force_value`` to select fields, like
  ``res.form['select'].force_value("new_value")``.  This makes it
  possible to simulate forms that are dynamically updated.  From
  Matthew Desmarais.

* Fixed :meth:`webtest.Response.mustcontain` when you pass in a
  ``no=[strings]`` argument.

1.1
---

* Changed the ``__str__`` of responses to make them more doctest
  friendly:

  - All headers are displayed capitalized, like Content-Type
  - Headers are sorted alphabetically

* Changed ``__repr__`` to only show the body length if the complete
  body is not shown (for short bodies the complete body is in the
  repr)

* Note: **these are backward incompatible changes** if you are using
  doctest (you'll have to update your doctests with the new format).

* Fixed exception in the ``.delete`` method.

* Added a ``content_type`` argument to ``app.post`` and ``app.put``,
  which sets the ``Content-Type`` of the request.  This is more
  convenient when testing REST APIs.

* Skip links in ``<script>...</script>`` tags (since that's not real
  markup).

1.0.2
-----

* Don't submit unnamed form fields.

* Checkboxes with no explicit ``value`` send ``on`` (previously they
  sent ``checked``, which isn't what browsers send).

* Support for ``<select multiple>`` fields (from Matthew Desmarais)

1.0.1
---

* Fix the ``TestApp`` validator's InputWrapper lacking support for
  readline with an argument as needed by the cgi module.

1.0
---

* Keep URLs in-tact in cases such as
  ``app.get('http://www.python.org')`` (so HTTP_HOST=www.python.org,
  etc).

* Fix ``lxml.html`` import, so lxml 2.0 users can get HTML lxml
  objects from ``resp.lxml``

* Treat ``<input type="image">`` like a submit button.

* Use ``BaseCookie`` instead of ``SimpleCookie`` for storing cookies
  (avoids quoting cookie values).

* Accept any ``params`` argument that has an ``items`` method (like
  MultiDict)
